I have implemented almost all aspects of this
assignment correctly.  The only aspect that
I would like to have implemented better was
the navigation bar on my bio.html and
resume.html pages.  I spent a lot of time
making it look nice and professional.  Despite
all the things I tried, I was not able to get
the nav-bar to look good on a large screen,
but also scale down and push buttons onto
subsequent lines for smaller screen sizes.
After trying many different things, I decided
to settle for an absolutely positioned nav-bar
that was an exact number of pixels.  Although
I was then able to control it better, it was
stuck at a fixed size.  The material I learned
in lecture today about resizing the page to fit
the browser window will help me fix this
problem in future versions.

I have not directly collaborated with anyone,
but I have discussed the project somewhat with
Lucy Qin, one of the TAs.  At first I was stuck
in the mindset of trying to control every aspect
of the HTML elements because of my meticulous
nature.  This wound up resulting in messy CSS
style sheets, and an inability to troubleshoot
CSS issues effectively because of too many
overlapping and conflicting rules.
Lucy helped me to start thinking about a web
page from a broad sense down to a narrow sense.
